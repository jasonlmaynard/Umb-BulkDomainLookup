# Umb-BulkDomainLookup
Bulk domain lookup against Umbrella Block lists

This allows security analysts to quickly determine if a domain is actually being blocked by Cisco Umbrella. The client running the script whether manual or scheduled must be protected by Cisco Umbrella to provide the results. Once you determine a domain is NOT blocked you can then add the output to a block list within Umbrella or any other defensice tool you might have.
